# Task-7.1-LW-Summer-and-Task-39-ARTH
In this task we have created a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) by showing our own creativity and UI/UX designing skills to make the web portal user friendly.

This app will help the user to run all the docker commmands like:
1. docker images
2. docker ps
3. docker run
4. docker rm -f
5. docker exec

etc. and try to cover the industry use cases also.
